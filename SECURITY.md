## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our digital sanctuary seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.** We do not want to expose users to risk.
2.  **Email:** Please email the maintainer directly (add your email here later) or open a **Draft Pull Request** with a description of the issue.
3.  **Response:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.

## Auditing
This project uses `npm audit` and strict dependency locking to ensure supply chain security.
